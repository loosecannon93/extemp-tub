I'm writing an application to build an ofline archive of news, for a Hugh School Speech Event called Extemperaneous Speaking.

 You have 30 min to write an impromptu speech, usually on current events.

Generally this requires bring large plastic tubs full of printed out articles, which must be catagorized and filed.

Since you can bring a laptop but cant use internet, im building a web front end in ruby on rails, to a Sphinx fulltext  indexed MySQL database of downloaded news articles.

I started with MSNBC, since they have no rate limits, and you dont need a key, and downloaded 30,000 articles, but i want to diverseify my sources.

Everything is purly academic, i am a High School student. And only a few of my classmates and I will be using this.
